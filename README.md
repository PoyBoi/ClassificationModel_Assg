# ClassificationModel_Assg

## Todo's
- [x] Add more classifiers
- [x] Add a few more models
    - [ ] Add them to a ipynb file for easier viewing
- [x] try out different LR solvers to see which gives the best results
- [x] implement ensemble learning from the code
- [x] implement the code for the ensemble learning
    - [x] Test it's F1 Score
- [x] Look online for methods to improve the F1 Score for each of the classifiers

## Extra
- [ ] Add a CLI for this to work with
- [ ] Add some graphs to see for dropout during training
- [ ] Try to add optimisers (gradient descent) to see if it improves the F1 Score
- [?] Make the readme look better
